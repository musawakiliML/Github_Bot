# Github_Bot

---

## Project Outline

I Used GitHubâ€™s API to request information about Projects(Python, Node.js, Php etc.) on the site, and then generate an interactive visualization of the relative popularity of these projects using Plotly. I built a Chatbot using Twilio and Flask(Python) to interact with users accepting those requests.

The Chatbot responds to users intent based on its command with either text or images(visualization).
